  <h1>You have chosen Red</h1>
  <p>Red is the color of fire.</p>
  <p>In a good mood, you radiate energy and vitality today, attracting attention. A good day for a new love or the beginning of a new passion.</p>
  <p>When you are in a bad mood, you are likely to become aggressive and angry quite quickly. Try to control the flaring anger somehow not to hurt anyone.</p>
