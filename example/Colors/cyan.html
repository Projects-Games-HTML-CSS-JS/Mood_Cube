  <h1>You have chosen Cyan</h1>
  <p>The color cyan (also called turquoise) is a refreshing color. It is the color of waters and beautiful sunny days.</p>
  <p>If you are in a good mood, you are probably well-rested and clear-headed. Take advantage of this mental openness and freedom to let your creativity run wild.</p>
  <p>If you have chosen the color in a bad mood, you should avoid people who are close to you, because this color also stands for coldness and distance, and thus you would only convey a feeling of emptiness.</p>
